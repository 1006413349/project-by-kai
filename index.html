		<h2>HISTORY</h2>
		<p>History of France: France is an independent nation in Western Europe and the center of a large overseas administration. It is the third-largest European nation (after Russia and Ukraine).
In ancient times France was part of the Celtic territory known as Gaul or Gallia. Its present name is derived from the Latin Francia, meaning "country of the Franks," a Germanic people who conquered the area during the 5th century, at the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It became a separate country in the 9th century.
Since the 17th century, France has played a major role in European and world events. In the 20th century, it has experienced numerous crises, including the devastation of two world wars, political and social upheavals, and the loss of a large empire in Indochina, Algeria, and West and Equatorial Africa. It has, however, survived and emerged from the ruins of World War II to become an important world supplier of agricultural and industrial products and a major partner in the EUROPEAN COMMUNITY (EC, or Common Market).
Today, the term metropolitan France refers to the mainland departments and CORSICA, a large island located in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Italy that has been a part of France since 1768. France has six overseas departments: FRENCH GUIANA in South America; GUADELOUPE and MARTINIQUE in the West Indies; MAYOTTE, an island formerly part of the Comoros, located in the Indian Ocean; REUNION, an island in the Indian Ocean; and SAINT PIERRE AND MIQUELON, islands off the east coast of Canada. In addition, France has numerous small possessions called overseas territories. These include a group of widely scattered islands in the South Pacific, which are administered from Tahiti and are known collectively as FRENCH POLYNESIA; FRENCH SOUTHERN AND ANTARCTIC TERRITORIES; NEW CALEDONIA and WALLIS AND FUTUNA ISLANDS; and many small islands in the southern oceans, including the Kerguelen and Crozet archipelagos and the islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam (Indian Ocean). The overseas departments and territories are represented in the French National Assembly

		History of England: England, which had subsumed Wales in the 16th century under Henry VIII, united with Scotland in 1707 to form a new sovereign state called Great Britain. Following the Industrial Revolution, Great Britain ruled a colonial Empire, the largest in recorded history. Although the unbroken line of Saxon kings was started with Alfred the Great, he was king of only Wessex. So a single Kingdom called England is 1091 years old.

		History of Japen: Japan was settled about 35,000 years ago by Paleolithic people from the Asian mainland. At the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, a culture called the Jomon developed. Jomon hunter-gatherers fashioned fur clothing, wooden houses, and elaborate clay vessels. According to DNA analysis, the Ainu people may be descendants of the Jomon.
The second wave of settlement by the Yayoi people introduced metal-working, rice cultivation, and weaving to Japan. DNA evidence suggests that these settlers came from Korea.
The first era of recorded history in Japan is the Kofun (A.D. 250-538), which was characterized by large burial mounds or tumuli. The Kofun were headed by a class of aristocratic warlords; they adopted many Chinese customs and innovations.
Buddhism came to Japan during the Asuka period, 538-710, as did the Chinese writing system. At this time, society was divided into clans. The first strong central government developed during the Nara period (710-794). The aristocratic class practiced Buddhism and Chinese calligraphy, while agricultural villagers followed Shintoism.
Japan's unique culture developed rapidly during the Heian era (794-1185). The imperial court turned out enduring art, poetry, and prose. The samurai warrior class developed at this time as well.
Samurai lords, called "shogun," took over the government in 1185, and ruled Japan in the name of the emperor until 1868. The Kamakura Shogunate (1185-1333) ruled much of Japan from Kyoto. Aided by two miraculous typhoons, the Kamakura repelled attacks by Mongol armadas in 1274 and 1281.
A particularly strong emperor, Go-Daigo, tried to overthrow the shogunate in 1331, resulting in a civil war between competing northern and southern courts that finally ended in 1392. During this time, a class of strong regional lords called "daimyo" increased in power; their rule lasted through the end of the Edo period, also known as the Tokugawa Shogunate, in 1868.
That year, a new constitutional monarchy was established, headed by the Meiji Emperor. The power of the shoguns came to an end.
After the Meiji Emperor's death, the emperor's son became the Taisho Emperor. His chronic illnesses kept him away from his duties and allowed the country's legislature to introduce new democratic reforms. During World War I, Japan formalized its rule over Korea and seized control of northern China.
The Showa Emperor, Hirohito, oversaw Japan's aggressive expansion during World War II, its surrender, and its rebirth as a modern, industrialized nation.

		<h2>STORY</h2>
		<p>
		Short story in France : La Parure (Guy de Maupassant).Guy de Maupassant is well known for his novels, but do you know he wrote some of the greatest French short stories?

The story is about a housewife who wishes she could live a lavish and ostentation life full of elegance and style. Her husband works for the government and doesn’t make a lot of money but one day he gets invited to a big party that will be filled with affluent people. His wife is very excited and asks her wealthy friend if she can borrow her precious necklace so she can look the part…but unfortunately, things don’t turn out so well.

		Short story in England : 1. "Half-mown Law", by Dan Powell (published in The Best British Short Stories 2012)
What's it about? 
A widow struggling to come to terms with her husband's sudden death.
Why should you read it?
Fair warning, this one's a real tear-jerker. It's also one of the most poignant and beautifully-written short stories I've ever read. The simple, straightforward descriptions of the main character going about her day-to-day life in the wake of her loss gives the tale a feeling of realism, which makes the final paragraphs all the more heartbreaking.
2. "The Sea in Birmingham", by Mick Scully (published in The Best British Short Stories 2014)
What's it about? 
Drama unfolds at a care home after one patient attacks another.
Why should you read it?
There are many important ingredients to a great short story, but I think one of the most crucial things — the thing most likely to make you remember a story long after you've re-shelved the book — is the final line. For some reason, the last line of "The Sea in Birmingham" really stayed with me. It's the perfect close to a story which is unsettling, mysterious, and brilliantly written. Nursing homes don't often feature as the settings for tales of crime and mystery, but Mike Scully uses one to great effect here.
3. "We Wave and Call", by Jon McGregor (published in The Best British Short Stories 2012)
What's it about? 
A swimmer fights against the current as he's slowly pulled out to see.
Why should you read it?
This might be the first short story I ever read that was written in the second person. I remember thinking it was a strange decision when I began reading, but I soon got sucked in. And in this case, the style works well. The story is all about the kind of tragedy you read about, but never expect to experience yourself — the second person narration makes it feel like a story being told about you, though, which helps you place yourself in the main character's shoes.		</p>
		<p>Short story in Japan: 1. Momotaro.Momotaro is one of the most loved folktales in Japan as well as one of the most well-known. The name "Momotaro" literally means "Peach Taro," which is a name suffix often seen in Japan. You may have heard the story translated as "Peach Boy."
According to the present form of the tale (dating to the Edo period), Momotarō came to Earth inside a giant peach, which was found floating down a river by an old, childless woman who was washing clothes there. The woman and her husband discovered the child when they tried to open the peach to eat it. The child explained that he had been sent by Heaven to be their son. The couple named him Momotarō, from momo (peach) and tarō (eldest son in the family).
Years later, Momotarō left his parents to fight a band of marauding oni (demons or ogres) on a distant island. En route, Momotarō met and befriended a talking dog, monkey, and pheasant, who agreed to help him in his quest. At the island, Momotarō and his animal friends penetrated the demons' fort and beat the band of demons into surrendering. Momotarō and his new friends returned home with the demons' plundered treasure and the demon chief as a captive. Momotarō and his family lived comfortably from then on.2. Urashima Taro.The story of Urashima Taro, the name of the main character, is about a fisherman who rescues a turtle and is rewarded with a special trip under the ocean to visit the kingdom of the Dragon God. The princess gives Urashima Taro a box and tells him that as long as he does not open it, he will stay happy, but of course, he opens the box when he returns to land.
